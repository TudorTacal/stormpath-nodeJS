### Stormpath - User Management

This project was done whilst at Makers Academy coding bootcamp, during the Christams holiday, following a tutorial from [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/blog/build-nodejs-express-stormpath-app).

It represents the implementation of a simple and easy to use user management system. Stormpath is an API service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store
user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications.  

I enjoyed this project because it gave me a glimpse into NodeJS through ExpressJS and other affiliate technologies that weren't covered at Makers Academy. 

## Technologies used

* **NodeJS**  
* **ExpressJS** as web framework.
* **Csurf** for CSRF protection.
* **Cookie-Parser** is used to read cookies that are created by the Csurf library.
* **Forms** is a module that handles form validations.
* **Jade** is a an engine for writing HTML pages.
* **Xtend** is a utility library that makes it easy to copy properties from one JavaScript object to another.
